# Microphone Button Disable/Enable Implementation

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. CSS Changes
- Added disabled state styling for microphone button in `static/style.css`
- Styles include:
  - Grayed out appearance
  - Disabled cursor (not-allowed)
  - Reduced opacity
  - Removed hover effects when disabled

### 2. JavaScript Changes
- Modified `static/script.js` to:
  - Disable microphone button on page load
  - Add `enableMicrophone()` and `disableMicrophone()` functions
  - Add API key status checking on page load via `/validate_api_keys` endpoint
  - Update both API key saving methods (main form and popup) to enable microphone when successful

### 3. Functionality Implemented
- ✅ Microphone button is disabled initially
- ✅ Status display shows "Please enter API keys to enable microphone" when disabled
- ✅ API key status is checked on page load
- ✅ Microphone becomes enabled after successful API key save via main form
- ✅ Microphone becomes enabled after successful API key save via popup
- ✅ Status display updates to "Ready to chat!" when enabled
- ✅ Visual disabled state styling applied

## 🔧 Files Modified
- `static/style.css` - Added disabled button styles
- `static/script.js` - Added disable/enable logic and API key status checking

## 🧪 Testing Required
- Load page and verify microphone button is disabled initially
- Enter API keys via main form and verify microphone becomes enabled
- Enter API keys via popup and verify microphone becomes enabled
- Test microphone functionality after enabling
- Verify status messages update correctly

## 📝 Notes
- The implementation assumes the backend `/validate_api_keys` endpoint exists and returns `{ valid: true/false }`
- Both API key saving methods now properly enable the microphone
- The disabled state is visually distinct and prevents clicking
